              details="When we pursue the highest performance of nano-electrical devices, it becomes crucial to manage the heat generation and dissipation, where thermal transport might be dominated by the thermal boundary resistance at the interfaces. We have explored nanoscale and microscale thermal transport by Raman thermal measurement and thermoreflectance technique with combinations of first-principle/molecular-dymanics calculations."

              details="As the field of tissue engineering advances, new tools for monitoring and evaluating of engineered tissues along with new biomaterials to direct tissue growth are needed. We use carbon nanotubes as an important tissue engineering material for improved tracking of cells, sensing of microenvironments, delivering of transfection agents, and scaffolding for incorporating with the hostâ€™s body. In addition, monitoring and alteringintra and intercellular processes would be useful for design of better engineered tissues. Since 2020, we have just started to make electronic and thermal device for creating and monitoring engineered tissue."
